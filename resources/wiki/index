Wiki, for what?:
  * documentation hosting
  * discuss decisions before implementation. The forums are not quite useful for it.
  * involve users in feature's discussion

[wiki:Documentation User documentation]


Visions for development:
  * TrayIconEnhancement - __implemented__
  * ImportExport - __partly implemented__
