== Activity/Monitoring support ==

Current status:
  * ask user every N minutes with common ChangeActiveTaskDialog 
  * saves (if setted) current screenshot after every popup event

Next stage:
 * detect user activity. Java and JNA (http://ochafik.free.fr/blog/?p=98)
 * choosing policy: ask every N min or detect user inactivity
 * reimplement active task dialogs/tray icon for better usability (Unintuitive behavior for monitoring dialog - ID: 2849132, Timing mechanizm - ID: 1185191, Interface and usability in Ubuntu - ID: 2894749)

Known todos:
 * screenshots (how useful this feature?)
  * removing old screenshots after configured days
  * ability to open linked screenshot in timeslot attribute in full size by open icon of just double click.
  * ability to delete screenshot, right from timeslot:
    * question if delete after attribute delete
    * timeslot's attribute remains but button for delete pressed.
  * in table with attributes add renderer for screenshot path and visualize the file is not found (for example deleted or moved).
  * the same but inside the attribute.
  * option in configuration to mass delete all screenshots attribute with optional to remove image files.
